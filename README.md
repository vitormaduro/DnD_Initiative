# DnD_Initiative
Controls the initiative order during a combat (made for D&amp;D, probably works with other systems). Written in C by Vitor Maduro for personal use. The code is avaiable for free, and no money was made because of it.


# Install
Just download the .c file and type "./DnD_Initiative". No need to install anything. For Windows you'll need to download a C compiler to generate the .exe file.

# Uninstall
Delete the .c file. Nothing was installed, so nothing needs to be uninstalled.

# License
Do whatever you want with the code/software, just credit me if you decide to publish anything related to my code.

# TO-DO
- Comment the code (sorry)
- Change all variables' names to English
- Language select
- Help screen
